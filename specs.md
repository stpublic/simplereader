# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered Chrome Extension for Reading Web Page Content Aloud

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Chrome browser extension that leverages OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API to audibly read the main content of web pages, effectively filtering out non-essential elements such as navigation menus, advertisements, and other peripheral content.

## Objectives

- **Content Extraction**: Accurately identify and extract the primary textual content from web pages.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Utilize OpenAI's TTS API to convert the extracted text into high-quality, natural-sounding speech.
- **User Interface**: Provide intuitive controls within the browser for users to initiate, pause, resume, and stop the reading process.
- **Customization**: Allow users to select preferred voices, adjust speech rate, and modify other audio settings.
- **Accessibility**: Enhance web accessibility for users who prefer auditory content consumption or have visual impairments.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Content Extraction

- **Main Content Identification**: Implement algorithms to discern and isolate the main textual content of a web page, excluding headers, footers, sidebars, advertisements, and other non-essential elements.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Ensure compatibility with dynamically loaded content, such as articles that load additional text upon scrolling.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Recognize and process content in multiple languages, aligning with the capabilities of OpenAI's TTS API.

### 2. Text-to-Speech Integration

- **OpenAI TTS API Utilization**: Integrate with OpenAI's TTS API to convert extracted text into speech. This includes:
  - **Voice Selection**: Provide users with a selection of voices available through OpenAI's platform.
  - **Speech Customization**: Allow adjustments to speech rate, pitch, and volume.
  - **Streaming Audio**: Stream the generated audio directly to the user without significant latency.

### 3. User Interface and Controls

- **Browser Extension Icon**: Display an icon in the Chrome toolbar to indicate the extension's presence and status.
- **Playback Controls**: Offer controls for play, pause, resume, and stop functionalities.
- **Settings Menu**: Provide a settings interface where users can:
  - Select preferred voices.
  - Adjust speech parameters (rate, pitch, volume).
  - Configure keyboard shortcuts for quick access.
- **Visual Feedback**: Indicate the current status (e.g., playing, paused) through the extension icon or a small overlay on the web page.

### 4. Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement customizable keyboard shortcuts for all primary functions to enhance accessibility.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Ensure the extension is compatible with popular screen readers and does not interfere with their operation.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Chrome Extension Development

- **Manifest Version**: Develop the extension using Manifest V3 to comply with current Chrome Web Store requirements.
- **Content Scripts**: Utilize content scripts to interact with web pages and extract content.
- **Background Service Workers**: Employ background service workers to manage API requests and audio streaming.

### 2. OpenAI TTS API Integration

- **Authentication**: Securely store and manage the OpenAI API key, ensuring it is not exposed in client-side code.
- **API Endpoints**: Use the appropriate OpenAI TTS API endpoints for text-to-speech conversion.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API requests, including managing rate limits and network errors.

### 3. Audio Playback

- **Streaming Audio**: Stream audio directly from the OpenAI TTS API to the user's browser to minimize latency.
- **Audio Controls**: Provide seamless integration with browser audio controls, allowing users to manage playback effectively.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

- **Latency**: Ensure minimal delay between initiating the reading process and the start of audio playback.
- **Resource Usage**: Optimize the extension to consume minimal system resources, preventing significant impact on browser performance.

### 2. Security and Privacy

- **Data Handling**: Clearly communicate to users how their data is processed and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
- **Permissions**: Request only the necessary permissions required for the extension's functionality.

### 3. Compatibility

- **Browser Support**: Ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Google Chrome.
- **Web Standards**: Adhere to web standards to maintain functionality across a wide range of websites.

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to click the extension icon to have the main content of the current web page read aloud, so that I can consume content audibly.
- **As a user**, I want to pause and resume the reading at any point, so that I can control the playback according to my needs.
- **As a user**, I want to select different voices and adjust speech settings, so that I can personalize the listening experience.
- **As a user with visual impairments**, I want the extension to be compatible with my screen reader, so that I can navigate and use the extension effectively.
